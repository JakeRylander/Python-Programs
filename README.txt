This repo is a compilation of various programs I have made in Python as part of my Introduction to Computer Science Class
for the Fall Semester of the Year 2014, of the University of Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras Campus.

Some Programs may have problems or be incomplete (In the sense that it's missing something to make it work better), if you do find any
of the sort feel free to send me a message or submit an issue ticket, so I may look into it.
